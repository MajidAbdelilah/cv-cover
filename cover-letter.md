Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineering position at your
company. With over 11 years of programming experience and a proven track
record of developing high-performance applications, I am confident in my ability
to make significant contributions to your team.
My journey in programming began at age 13 with a simple ambition: to create
HTML games. Though my first game didn’t gain traction, the experience ignited
a passion for coding that has only grown stronger. Over the years, I’ve mastered
multiple programming languages and technologies, including C/C++, Python,
JavaScript, and specialized in both game development and web applications.

What sets me apart is my dedication to pushing technical boundaries. When I
wanted to impress potential employers, I didn’t just learn existing technologies
I built my own. Most recently, I developed a GPU-Accelerated 3D Particle System
using SYCL that eﬀiciently simulates over 1,000,000 particles in real-time
with 56 FPS on an intel integrated GPU. My rendering engine “Gabriel” achieved 385% better performance
than Godot, and my optimization work on the open-source Physics3D project
improved its performance by 25%. These achievements demonstrate not just
technical skill, but my commitment to excellence.

Currently, I’m applying my entrepreneurial spirit to SAMMA.app, a market-
place for Arabic indie games built with modern web technologies. This project
showcases my ability to handle full-stack development, from frontend UI with
React to backend integration with Supabase, including authentication systems
and cloud infrastructure management.

My professional experience includes an internship as a Full Stack Developer at Nommo from May to November 2025, where I contributed to building Morocco's first stock market platform. Working with a modern tech stack including Next.js and React for frontend development and Nest.js for backend services, I gained valuable experience in developing high-performance financial technology applications. This role strengthened my expertise in creating secure, responsive web applications that handle complex data operations and mission-critical skills directly applicable to your engineering needs.

I am currently learning Verilog for hardware design with the ambitious goal of designing my own optimized processor architecture. This pursuit reflects my desire to understand computing systems at their most fundamental level and eliminate dependencies on third-party optimization solutions. By mastering hardware design, I aim to create the ultimate processor specifically tailored for the computational challenges I frequently encounter, further demonstrating my commitment to end-to-end system optimization and technological self-sufficiency.

At 1337 coding school, I consistently rank among the top students, finishing
the common core curriculum second among 300+ peers. My projects regularly
exceed evaluation standards, receiving scores of 115-125/100.
I bring to the table not just technical expertise, but also the initiative to solve
complex problems, a proven ability to optimize systems, and experience working
both independently and collaboratively. I’m eager to bring these qualities to
your team and contribute to your company’s success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my
skills and experience align with your needs.
Sincerely,

Abdelilah Majid
